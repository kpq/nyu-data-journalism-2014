The basic types of charts include line charts, area charts, bar charts, scatterplots and pie charts. How should you decide which one to use? And how can we make them?

##Housekeeping

- [Project timeline.](../../projects/) Are you on track for success?

##Your goal
- Before class is over, post a bar chart about [plastic surgery](http://www.isaps.org/Media/Default/global-statistics/ISAPS-Results-Procedures-2011.pdf]) (thanks Ronan) and/or a line chart about [drought](http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/MapsAndData/DataTables.aspx) (thanks Katie) to your github page
- Style a paragraph of text below your chart (it can be lorem ipsum), borrowing inspriration from the way [Medium](https://medium.com/cool-code-pal/70abf2d96a10) styles their paragraphs

##Your team choices

- Team Excel
 - You might follow [Cole Nussbaumer's guide.](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/2011/11/how-to-do-it-in-excel.html)
- Team Service
  - You might try out [Datawrapper](http://datawrapper.de/)
- Team Be in Charge
  - You might try out [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery)


[Variance](https://variancecharts.com/examples/) has a nice description of some of the trade-offs. And people are working on tools, like [Lyra](http://idl.cs.washington.edu/projects/lyra/), that blend some of your options.
