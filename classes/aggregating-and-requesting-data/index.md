title: Aggregating

In our quest to master "sort, filter, aggregate, merge," we forgot aggregate.

## Housekeeping
- Six of you have not signed up for a date on the [critique wiki](https://github.com/kpq/nyu-data-journalism-2014/wiki/Critique-Schedule). 

- Learning how to learn, a [Kiln](http://kiln.it/) example with [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/Y3Jp6/)

- Should we talk about [enough html](super-limited.html) to make your work look less terrible?

- The NICAR conference is going on this week. [Some materials](http://blog.chryswu.com/2014/02/21/nicar14-slides-tutorials-links-tools/). [Some ideas](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlAO8PborOXDdG81U19NTGM3WVJ3cS1KS0p5dTZyekE&usp=sharing#gid=0). [The mailing list](http://www.ire.org/resource-center/listservs/subscribe-nicar-l/)

## Solving your problems + aggregate warm-ups

- Let's start with a [smaller dataset](yoga-journal-anatomical-focus.csv) about the [anatomical focus of yoga poses](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/finder/anatomical_focus), as listed on yogajournal.com.
	* What area of the body has the most poses listed?
	* What pose shows up the most often?
	* What are all the poses that focus on both the brain and the calves?

- We also have a [larger dataset](aamaadmiparty.csv) about [donations](http://www.aamaadmiparty.org/donation-list) to a new political party in India. [Feel the power course](aamaadmipartyDonations.rb). 
	* The biggest donations?
	* Amount received from people in each country?
	* The typical donation size?
	* Average donation size by country?
	* Biggest days?

## Where we left off.
- Don't try to be too complicated at the beginning. Start with very easy questions - think averages, top 10 lists, outliers. After you have those answers, then you can add fanciness.
- We are looking for things that we don't expect. [Washington Monthly's rankings](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/rankings_2013/national_university_rank.php) are based on the same idea.
- Find two schools that with similar characteristics, but very different graduation rates.

## Expanding our college graduation sample. If we were to try, how far would we have to go?

Here's [a list of schools](../pieces-together-interviewing-data/list-of-schools.csv) for that. How many schools would we have to contact if we wanted to cover, say, half of the nation's undergraduates? 75%? How else could we restrict our sample?

## Write our letter.

Let's do it together [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QVt45d0JfwLfa0RQtjULr68jZeWFKqEN6Ij4RU5sGVY/edit#).

##Homework
You have two choices. You may fill out 20 rows with contact information in [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvKWOz9eYW7ydGxfNnRGWnI4Vm9mT0thRnc2U2dSYWc#gid=0). Or you may embark on your own data collection project of a similar scale. If you choose the later, please push it to your github page.
