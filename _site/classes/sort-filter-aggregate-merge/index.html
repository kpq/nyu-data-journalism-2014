  <p>How do you interview a spreadsheet like a human being? Today, we&rsquo;ll work on turning a spreadsheet into a story, a source, a chart or something else journalistically valuable.</p>

<h2>Housekeeping</h2>

<ul>
<li>Does everyone have a working github.io page?</li>
<li>  Make sure your info is right on the <a href="https://github.com/kpq/nyu-data-journalism-2014/wiki/Class-wiki">wiki</a></li>
<li>  Are you sure you&rsquo;ve signed up for the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nyu-data-journalism-2014">Google group</a>?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Discussion: The data you brought</h2>

<p>Please add a short description of the data you brought to class <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QVt45d0JfwLfa0RQtjULr68jZeWFKqEN6Ij4RU5sGVY/edit">here.</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Did anyone do anything interesing to collect their data? <a href="http://deadspin.com/infographic-is-your-states-highest-paid-employee-a-co-489635228">Doing the work</a> might get you somewhere interesting. </p></li>
<li><p>What format did you bring your data in? </p></li>
<li><p>Right now, how many of your datasets are really just about New York, California and Texas being big?</p></li>
<li><p>If you were to present your data, what are some of the choices — like <a href="http://www.macwright.org/d3-curvy/">color</a> – that would affect how your readers interpret it? Here&rsquo;s a real-world example of how even-reasonable <a href="http://wonkviz.tumblr.com/post/68781802020/a-tale-of-two-choropleths">color choices matter.</a></p></li>
<li><p>How would you decide if your map <a href="http://www.ericson.net/content/2011/10/when-maps-shouldnt-be-maps/">shouldn&rsquo;t be a map?</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Basic skills</h2>

<p>Here is some data on <a href = "http://kpq.github.io/sherp-31/assets/data/drunkdrivingdeaths.xls">drunk driving deaths</a> in 2011.</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the data to your computer, and open it in your spreadsheet program of choice. </li>
<li>What were the 3 states with the most deaths? The 3 with the fewest?</li>
<li>Here is some data on <a href = "http://kpq.github.io/sherp-31/assets/data/statepopulation.xls"> population</a>. Add it to your spreadsheet using a function called <code>vlookup</code>. </li>
<li>What were the states with the highest rates? The lowest?</li>
<li>How many deaths occured in the South? What region of the country had the highest rate of deaths? Here are some <a href = "http://kpq.github.io/sherp-31/assets/data/nytnames.xls">region codes</a> that might help you. For practice, answer this question by using a <code>pivot table</code>. Pivot tables are one way to summarize data.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Excel work doesn&rsquo;t have to look like it</h2>

<p><img src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/multimedia/bundles/projects/2013/BostonMoment/moment1600.jpg"></p>

<p>Your job is to identify as many people as you can in the picture above.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The easiest people to identify in the picture should be the runners. From  the online <a href="http://boston-iframe.r.mikatiming.de/2013/?event=R&idp=999999117A7326000008693E&pid=start">results</a>, acquire a spreadsheet of the last runners to finish.</p></li>
<li><p>Here&rsquo;s a wrinkle: not everyone in the photo started at the same time. Here&rsquo;s what the race organizers have to say about that: &ldquo;Red bibs (numbers 101 - 8,999) are assigned to Wave 1 (10:00 a.m.). White bibs (numbers 9,000 to 17,999) are assigned to Wave 2 (10:20 a.m.). Blue bibs (numbers 18,000 +) are assigned to Wave 3 (10:40 a.m.).&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>Subtract 40 minutes from the finish gun off of everyone with a bib number less than 9000, and 20 minutes from everyone with a bib number from 9000 to 17999.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a list of runners to call. Put their first and last names into separate columns with some combination of &ldquo;Data -&gt; Text to columns&rdquo; and find and replace.</p></li>
<li><p>Here&rsquo;s the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/04/22/sports/boston-moment.html">NYT take.</a></p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Basic skills when your data is bigger</h2>

<p>A digression: sometimes data is published to the web, but, without context, it&rsquo;s hard to know whether it&rsquo;s interesting or not. Here&rsquo;s <a href = "http://schools.nyc.gov/AboutUs/data/Attendance.htm">an example</a> about 
<a href = "http://www.wnyc.org/story/fewer-faces-nyc-schools-after-storm/">NYC school attendance from WNYC.</a>
It&rsquo;s easy to pull down this data every day, but, pretty quickly, it&rsquo;s going to get big enough that you will regret any cheating / manual labor you might have done in our earlier exercises today.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>See if you can find where the data that powers the <a href = "http://citibikenyc.com/stations">Citibike stations map</a> lives.</p></li>
<li><p>Here is the same <a href = "http://kpq.github.io/sherp-31/assets/data/bikes.csv">data</a> for every 15 minutes on Wednesday, June 5.</p></li>
<li><p>Filter the data to look at a single station.</p></li>
<li><p>What time of day are the fewest bikes available system-wide?</p></li>
<li><p>Add a column for which <a href = "http://kpq.github.io/sherp-31/assets/data/bike-neighborhoods.csv">neighborhood</a> each station belongs to, and answer the same question for Midtown South, the East Village, and another neighborhood of your choice. <img width = 300 src="neighborhoods.png"></p></li>
<li><p>Why might you want to collect this data yourself instead of just asking CitiBike?</p></li>
<li><p>In the <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QVt45d0JfwLfa0RQtjULr68jZeWFKqEN6Ij4RU5sGVY/edit">Google doc</a> we used earlier today, make a list of questions we could answer with this type of data, either by itself, or by joining it to other data. </p></li>
</ol>
